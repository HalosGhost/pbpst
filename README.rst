=====

``pbpst`` is a small tool to make interacting with ``pb`` instances as simple as possible.
``pb`` is a versatile, free and open source pastebin which has more features, is more robust and is faster than any other pastebin with which I am familiar.
You can find the reference instance (which tracks `pb's master branch <https://github.com/ptpb/pb>`_) at `ptpb <https://ptpb.pw>`_.
Ideally, ``pbpst`` will support as many features of ``pb`` as possible (hopefully, nearly all) in a simple, unassuming CLI.
