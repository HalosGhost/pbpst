Eventually, this repo will play host to the source for a replacement for my command-line client for ``pomf``.
``pomf`` was a decent tool, but was essentially useless in terms of its use as a pastebin and its author has said someâ€¦ questionable things.
`ptpb <https://ptpb.pw>`_, on the other hand, is the most versatile pastebin I have ever seen while still maintaining all the power of ``pomf`` (with a larger filesize cap too!).

The goal of this utility is to support as many features of ``ptpb`` as possible (hopefully, all) in a simple cli.
